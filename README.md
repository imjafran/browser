DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================

Browser Detective is a comprehensive web-based tool that provides detailed 
insights about your browser, device, system, and network information. It 
creates a complete "fingerprint" of your browsing environment for security 
analysis, debugging, or educational purposes.

All data is processed locally in your browser with complete privacy protection.
No information is stored on servers - data sharing works through URL encoding.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===============================================================================

Q: Is my data stored anywhere?
A: No, all data is processed locally in your browser. Nothing is stored on servers.

Q: How does sharing work?
A: Data is encoded in the URL itself. When you share a link, the data travels 
   directly through the URL parameters.

Q: Why do some shared links show "Unknown" values?
A: Older share links or links from different browser versions may have limited 
   data. New shares include comprehensive information.

Q: Is this tool safe to use?
A: Yes, it only reads publicly available browser information and doesn't 
   access any personal data, passwords, or sensitive information.

Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?
A: Contact the developer for commercial licensing and usage permissions.

Q: How accurate is the location information?
A: Location is based on IP geolocation, which is generally accurate to city 
   level but may vary depending on your internet provider.
